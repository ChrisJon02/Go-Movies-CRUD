<H1> Build a CRUD API using GO </H1>

Hey folks! this is yet another simple Go project. 
Built a CRUD API 

C - CREATE
R - READ
U - UPDATE
D - DELETE

Command to start the server at localhost:8000 -> go run main.go

After starting the server, open POSTMAN and create a folder and then create 5 new requests - GET ALL, GET BY ID, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE.
